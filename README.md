## Features
* Asset System: A robust asset management system with a dedicated manager for efficient handling of assets.
* Input System: Simplified input handling for key and mouse inputs, providing ease of use for interaction.
* Lights System: Integrated support for various lighting types, including spotlights, point lights, and directional lights.
* Material System: A comprehensive material system designed with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) principles. Allows for texture channel selection, enhancing material customization.
* Mesh System: Simple yet powerful mesh representation for handling primitives like quads, cubes, and laying the groundwork for more complex models.
* Render Pass Pipeline: Luly Engine features a sophisticated render pass pipeline that defines the rendering infrastructure. The pipeline includes a base render pass class and multiple implementations for passes such as geometry, lighting, shadows, and more.
* Scene System: A comprehensive scene management system comprising a scene manager, scene actors, and a collection of scene actor components. This system provides a structured approach to interacting with the engine within different scenes.
* Profiling System: Integration of Tracy as the primary profiling tool, offering detailed monitoring of various engine methods for performance analysis.
* UI System: Implementation of ImGui for an intuitive and user-friendly debugging interface. Allows developers to visualize and debug tools and features seamlessly.s.
